# Custom WooCommerce Shipping Method for Kenyan Regions and Locations in Nairobi
 
 
## ==== The Challange =====
 
Due to its vast size, both the country of Kenya and its capital city, Nairobi, cannot be considered as a single shipping zone. This poses a challenge to implementing varying prices for different regions. Moreover, the postal code feature cannot be relied upon as addressing in the country is poor, with few people having physical addresses that are often outdated or limited to P.O. Box numbers. It is recommended that Kenya be split into distinct shipping zones, similar to the approach taken in Nigeria and Angola. Similarly, Nairobi should be divided into smaller locations to allow for more accurate and efficient shipping calculations.
